        "One option is to use Rivana: Download the data, unzip it, and work on it in a persistent environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other option is to avoid opening the entire file at once, and instead work with chunks of the data. That's what this code does for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "On GitHub, the data are broken into three smaller files, saved in .parquet format. The code below will load these chunks into memory, one at a time, you can specify the variables you want in `var_list`, and the results will be saved in `selected_gss_data.csv`.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can add more cleaning instructions in between the lines where the data are loaded ( `df = pd.read_parquet(url)`) and the data are saved (`df.loc...`). It's probably easiest to use this code to get only the variables you want, and then clean that subset of the data."
